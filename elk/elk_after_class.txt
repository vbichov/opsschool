this task assumes that you've successfully used the pluralsight (or any other resource) to install a working elk stack. if not - please contact me.

kibana and elasticsearch services should be running, losgstash service should not.

all logstash example configurations located in logstash_examples
all filebeat example configurations located in filebeat_examples

At the end of this flow you are expeced to create a visualization that counts different log levels of grafana.

1. run logstash with the `stdin_stdout.conf`
   bin/logstash -f stdin_stdout.conf
  
   play with it a bit, try sending values in key value format (mygost=casper car=ferrary)
   read about logstash stdin and stdout plugins:
   https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/input-plugins.html
   https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/output-plugins.html

2. run logstash with the `stdin_kv_stdout.conf`
   bin/logstash -f stdin_kv_stdout.conf
   
   try sending the same (or similar) input. Try sending values in key value format

   read about kv filter plugin
   https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/filter-plugins.html


3. make sure elasticsearch and kibana are working
   point the elasticsearch output plugin in stdin_kv_stdout_elastic.conf to relevant installation of elasticsearch
   run logstash with the `stdin_kv_stdout_elastic.conf`
   send some key value events (I.E. foo=bar ip=1.2.3.4)
   send some non key value events (I.E. brown dog ate yello chicken)
   try finding those events in the discover tab using the query syntax
   https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.x/query-dsl-query-string-query.html#query-string-syntax

4. download filebeat (feel free to use whatever version you're comfortable    ether deb/rpm or tar.gz) on an instance with running grafana

5. run filebeat with `stdin_stdout.yml`
   ./filebeat run -c stdin_stdout.yml
   try sending it some messages and see what it returns
   notice the speed at which it starts up

6. sending events to elastic with filebeat:
   fix the location of elastic in `stdin_elastic.yml` and run filebeat with   this configuration
   try sending some events and search them in kibana

7. configure logstash to receive input events from  beats (see beats_kb_stdout_elastic.conf) and send them to elastic
   configure filebeat to send events to logstash (see stdin_logstash.conf)
   send some events thru beats and find them in kibana

8. the destination of this journey:
   find where grafana logs are kept.
   notice that most of the logs are in key value format.
   configure filebeat to read those logs and send them to losgstash which in turn will send them to elastic

9. find the grafana logs in kibana.
   create a visualization over those logs 
   for instance a pie chart that shows different log levels received from grafana
