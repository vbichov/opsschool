In this session we're going to use the elastic stack to collect logs from grafana
This installation will be used in the rest of the course in order to collect logs from various systems


Please set up an AWS instance and install the elastic stack on it

There is a pluralsight lecture that explains how to do that
https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/centralized-logging-elastic-stack/

If you're not a fan of ubuntu/debian - there are plenty of ther resources that explain how to do that.

If you have issues setting up instances in AWS please let me know (@vitalyb on slack) Yaron had built have a cloudformation that will set up the hosts here:
https://github.com/ops-school/opsschool-cloudformation/blob/master/opsschool_cloudformation_monitoring.yaml


After the ELK stack is installed go over the following:
